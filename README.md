## Comp Time Calculator
A tool to calculate compensatory travel time.

## Usage
Begin by specifying start and end times for travel. If regular work hours fall within the travel hours then specify start and end times for work. Note that the work range must be within the travel range. Some types of travel have rules that cap the allowable compensatory travel time. When this is applicable specify the cap time. The cap time can sometimes be easier to specify after first calculating the travel and work time.
